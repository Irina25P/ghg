# Christmas Animation Project - README

- I started by creating a humanoid character in blender 4.2, using the tutorial: https://youtu.be/IhIGVO4fqLg?si=zp59mVnvPdgp_Bfb  
- After that I added it armature for moving it and I also used Inverse Kinematics for a better control, being inspired by this video: https://youtu.be/mYgznqvbisM?si=m17v08NRrIk1tLYd  
- I coppied the character into 2 separate blender files and I modelled to obtain the alien and Santa Claus.  
- For the alien, I made his head bigger and the members thiner and I coloured the skin in green, in shading mode, applying precedural texturing to look similar to the skin and mapping into bumps. (video: https://youtu.be/iDXGPsrO0_M?si=5JfmDIfgM8ByPvQp)  
- From that moment, I moved to blender 3.6 because the other version of blender it was not supoorted on my laptop and it crashed when I tried to use shading mode.  
- For the santa I coloured the skin normally and I put on him some clothes adding a texture from a photo in UV Editing mode, using UV Image Wrapping. The shoes and the hat are downloaded from the website:  
- After finishing my two characters, I imported the UCC Student Centre from the link provided and the other objects from sketchfab (spaceship, snow blanket, christmas tree, presents, clouds, green ring, dino students).  
- With all objects I set up the entire scene, establishing their position, their sizes, and also the camera position.  
- The light consists of a sun above all, a small yellow light above the star and 4 lights, red and green, in front of the spaceshift to create a christmassy atmosphere.  
- After defining all the details for the scene to look nice, I moved all objects below the snow blanket with -1000. Before that, I tried hiding them from the camera view but I did not manage in any way.  

## Keyframe Animation
- Firstly, I chose the length of 1500 frames (250 frames are 10 seconds => 6x250 = 1500).  
- I started animating the clouds (inspiration video: https://youtu.be/dF3JMt3uM1E?si=JzkpgWqTjCWC0liE).  
- After that, I was curious about cloth animation and I watched the following video: https://youtu.be/pFBkikMBW0U?si=q2wFs4QKvB89UnhN and I tried creating a flag with “Merry Christmas” message from a photo with transparancy.  
- I continued with the animation of the spaceship’s arrival from the main position in the scene to the one when it is visible in the camera view (going backwards and memorising the moves).  
- I coppied those moves to create the leaving path and I rotated the spaceship with an angle of 180 degrees. I used bezier type for the movements.  
- The appearance of the characters and of the christmas tree are through the green ring. (Liniar movements).  
- Next, I tried creating a hand waving for both characters and a smooth walk for the alien to the christmas tree.  
- The dino stundents suddenly appeared from the snow and with a little of “Christmas Magic” they received presents.  
- In the end, the characters left through the green ring back to the spaceship and then it returned in the sky.  
- I added a 3D text specifying the title of the video: “Christmas is here”.
